# Debug Mode Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
- Database migration from localStorage to IndexedDB happens automatically on version 2
- Extension logs only visible in "Extension Host" output channel, not Debug Console
- Webview dev tools accessed via Command Palette > "Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools"
- Pollinations API errors logged with specific error codes (402 = payment required)
- Dexie.js database debugging requires browser dev tools > Application > IndexedDB
- Character generation failures often due to JSON schema violations (check network tab)
- Audio generation failures return null silently (no error thrown)
- Database connection issues resolved by clearing browser storage and refreshing
- Vite dev server must be running for webview debugging (npm run dev)
- Prisma database operations require separate terminal for schema management
